# Hardware
My solution was composed by a single board computer and two Hard Disk Drive.

## Board
My solution was the **ZimaBlade 7700 NAS Kit**, which incluses:
  - The board ZimaBlade 7700
  - 16 GB of RAM
  - 2 Bay HDD Rack
  - SATA Y Cable
  - The power adapter
  - Mini Display port to HDMI

# How to chose the Board
There are multiple board solutions for NAS and cloud, e.g., Raspberry Pi 4/5 or Orange Pi, and all of them are good alternatives to the ZimaBlade. I decided to buy the ZimaBlade because it exposes two SATA interfaces. The processor is a 4-core Intel, and 16 GB of RAM can easily handle multiple instances of NextCloud. Unlike the other boards, ZimaBlade was developed specifically for NAS rather than for multiple IoT purposes, like the Raspberry Pi. Thus, the ZimaBlade was suitable for my cloud blade solution.


# How to chose the HDD
why 2 and not 3?

Chossing the board was not very timing consuming, I just whatched some videos on youtube, and I foud my solution. Instead,the HDD choise was not easy, it required long time.
