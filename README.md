## Introduction
Creating a personal cloud is a long journey. It requires a lot of time to investigate which is the best solution for you at the moment. I explored multiple technologies, boh hardware and software, to create my home made cloud device based on my requrementes. 

### Rationale
What I'm looking to create is a family cloud, where we can store photos or data with high reliability and integrity, for 4 or 5 people. The data must be reachable anywhere with a good user experience. Web applications and mobile applications for both Android and iOS must be available.
A very important point is security. Nobody must be able to access the system; even the system administrator (me) must not be able to access other people's data.
Moreover, price, the device must be "cheap" and must cousume less power as possible. 

### Consideration
This blog is not about how to create a self-hostesd cloud, is about how my cosideration my experience aboud self hotest, which could help you to take the best solution for you enviroment. My choeses could not match your wish. From this experiments I learned multiple new technologies which is not common to use in my daly routene. So, I could makes mistekes, I'm not a cloud developer, even a developer.

### About me
I'm self-hosting appassionate with a strong backgound in cybersecurity. I have more than 10 yeas os experience in cybersecurity, I tested from cybersecurity prospective multiple applications, from hardware to cloud bases.
