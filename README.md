## Introduction
Creating a personal cloud is a long journey. It requires a lot of time to investigate which is the best solution for you at the moment. I explored multiple technologies, from hardware to software.

### Rationale
What I'm looking to create is a family cloud, where we can store photos or data with high reliability and integrity, for 4 or 5 people. The data must be reachable anywhere with a good user experience. Web applications and mobile applications for both Android and iOS must be available.
A very important point is security. Nobody must be able to access the system; even the administrator (me) must not be able to access other people's data.
